# TODO — ABM-ACE Roadmap

This roadmap balances **scientific rigor** with **engineering transparency**.

## Research / Model
- [ ] Validate baseline results against toy analytical benchmarks.
- [ ] Add heterogeneous risk preferences (prospect theory vs. CRRA).
- [ ] Implement endogenous network rewiring under shocks.
- [ ] Compare progressive tax vs. climate-risk insurance.
- [ ] Introduce heterogeneous climate exposure by geography.

## Engineering / Reproducibility
- [ ] Add experiment runner + configuration sweeps.
- [ ] Add unit tests for metrics (Gini, resilience index).
- [ ] Add deterministic seeding and reproducibility checks.
- [ ] Build documentation pages with parameter glossary.
- [ ] Add CI (linting + tests).

## Accountability / Transparency
- [ ] Log all assumptions in a structured YAML registry.
- [ ] Add ethics note on ABM limitations and policy interpretation.
